# Makeup for all Assignments - AME 394 Advanced JS Programming

## Instructions:
### Assignment 1:
 - $ node server.js
 - In browser, type in following url, with any number as n:
     + localhost:3942/getFibonacci?n=9

### Assignment 2 & 3:
 - Test any sort of expression
 - Notes: I submitted a version of this assignment that converted to postfix, but that did not evaluate the expression. I was working on that feature but unfortunately I was not able to finish it in time. I finished it about 30 minutes after the 11:59 deadline. I will push it, however, you can look at the commit and push I did before the deadline and grade that one if you'd like, I just wanted to finisht the feature for my own peace of mind.

### Assignment 4:
 - Add a variety of nodes
 - Change their location by dragging
 - In the console, look at *linkedList.nodes* before and after dragging them to their new location
